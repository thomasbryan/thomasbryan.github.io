<h4>All About Me</h4>
<p>I am a Web Application Developer whose primary focus is developing with PHP. I am always open to learning more, and have played around with C, C++, Java, Perl, Python, and Ruby. I have a background and several years of experience with Unix / Linux Administration, and have also been known to administrate some Windows Servers too. Also, I have learned about the Cisco IOS as well as some general networking infrastructure. I would like to start some development of Apple iOS applications and will hopefully release my first application fairly soon.</p>
<p>I currently live in Dallas with my wonderful wife. We have cats that keep us busy when we are not watching movies or going out. I enjoy listening to most genres of music. When I have the opportunity I really enjoy exploring the world. In my spare time I find time to play video games.</p>
