<header><h1>Rubik's Cube</h1></header>
<p>The Rubik's Cube was invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ernő Rubik. It is a puzzle game where one must turn the cube's faces to align colored tiles.</p>

<h3>Singmaster notation</h3>
<p>The following list of notations was developed by David Singmaster, who was a professor of mathematics at London South Bank University. This notation was developed to easily describe a method to solving the Rubik's Cube. That is to say given a scrambled Rubik's Cube, turn any number of sides until each face of the cube has 9 of the same colored tiles. Utilizing this notation allows algorithms to be created regardless of orientation of the cube. The notation is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>F (Front): the side currently facing the solver</li>
<li>B (Back): the side opposite the front</li>
<li>U (Up): the side above or on top of the front side</li>
<li>D (Down): the side opposite the top, underneath the Cube</li>
<li>L (Left): the side directly to the left of the front</li>
<li>R (Right): the side directly to the right of the front</li>
<li>f (Front two layers): the side facing the solver and the corresponding middle layer</li>
<li>b (Back two layers): the side opposite the front and the corresponding middle layer</li>
<li>u (Up two layers) : the top side and the corresponding middle layer</li>
<li>d (Down two layers) : the bottom layer and the corresponding middle layer</li>
<li>l (Left two layers) : the side to the left of the front and the corresponding middle layer</li>
<li>r (Right two layers) : the side to the right of the front and the corresponding middle layer</li>
<li>x (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on R</li>
<li>y (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on U</li>
<li>z (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on F</li>
</ul>
<p>When a prime symbol ( ′ ) follows a letter, it denotes a face turn counter-clockwise, while a letter without a prime symbol denotes a clockwise turn. A letter followed by a 2 (occasionally a superscript 2) denotes two turns, or a 180-degree turn. R is right side clockwise, but R′ is right side counter-clockwise. The letters x, y, and z are used to indicate that the entire Cube should be turned about one of its axes, corresponding to R, U, and F turns respectively. When x, y or z are primed, it is an indication that the cube must be rotated in the opposite direction. When they are squared, the cube must be rotated 180 degrees.</p>
